# Passbolt 1.14.0-22 Android app release notes

## Added
- You can now store TOTP data in Passbolt and generate TOTP codes! (once enabled on the backed)
- Add TOTP manually or by scanning a QR code
- View, search, delete TOTPs

## Fixed
- Fixed a random sign in failure issue occurring on some devices; related to client-backend time synchronisation
- Now if time difference is low, the sync is handled on the client and if it's big, an info message is shown
