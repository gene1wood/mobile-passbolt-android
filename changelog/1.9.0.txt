# Passbolt 1.9.0-11 Android app release notes

## Added
- In-app update flow - when a new version is released you will receive in-app notification and in-app update&installation process

## Improved
- Resized resource menu icons to common dimensions
- Add uncaught exception handling - now they will be logged to file (if debug logs are enabled)

## Fixed
- Expanded search app bar when search has empty results (there was a scenario when empty state could be shown while search bar
could be swiped up - and no way to clear the the search query)
- Fixed scenario when both session and passphrase expired and after clicking on a secret "eye" icon there was a need of clicking twice
to see the secret
- Fixed slight blinking when creating settings view and resource menu view

## Maintenance
- Currently only for debuggable application (UI testing & development) - there is a possibility to inject user account using
ADB command
